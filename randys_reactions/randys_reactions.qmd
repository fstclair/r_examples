## Violin plot

NICE!  I like violin plots and feel they should be used more!  Some notes:

* Check out Pirate Plots https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yarrr/vignettes/pirateplot.html
* Totally OK, you added a package making your plot not base R
* In the future add the URL of the tutorial so you or others can find it
* Note the comments-if you wrote them, AWESOME, if they are from the tutorial thanks for keeping as they will be a good example for your future code.
