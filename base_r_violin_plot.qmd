## Violin Plots

-   Violin plots compare the distribution of several groups

-   *vioplot* library is a way to build violin plots in R

## *vioplot*

-   Builds a violin plot as a boxplot with a rotated kernel density plot on each side

-   To represent several groups, use the *with* function

## Violin Plot of *C. bombi* Rosette Formation in the Presence of Sunflower and Buckwheat Pollen *in vitro*

```{r} 
#| echo: false
# Load the vioplot library 
library(vioplot) 
?vioplot #for vioplot description

# Create data

treatment <- c(rep("Sunflower Pollen", 25) , rep("Buckwheat Pollen", 25)) #two treatment groups with how many total
value <- c( sample(4:10, 25 , replace=T) , sample(c(6:16), 25 , replace=T) ) #values of each sample with how many total
data <- data.frame(treatment,value) #create data frame with the treatment and values created

colors <- c("yellow", "orange") #set the colors for SF and BW pollen
  
# Draw the plot

with(data , 
     vioplot( value[treatment=="Sunflower Pollen"] , value[treatment=="Buckwheat Pollen"], #create plot with the values and treatments set above
      ylab = "Number of Rosettes", #add y-axis labels
      col=colors , #set colors
      names=c("Sunflower Pollen","Buckwheat Pollen") )) #set names of each group on x-axis

```
